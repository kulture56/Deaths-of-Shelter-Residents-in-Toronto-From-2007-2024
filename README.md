# Deaths-of-Shelter-Residents-in-Toronto-From-2007-2024
Exploratory Data Analysis of Mortality Rates of Shelter Residents in Toronto (2007–2024)


Overview
This project analyzes mortality trends among shelter residents in Toronto from 2007 to 2024. By examining publicly available data, the study aims to uncover patterns and insights that can inform policy decisions and improve support systems for vulnerable populations.​

Objectives
Assess annual and monthly mortality trends among shelter residents.

Identify demographic patterns related to age, gender, and other factors.

Visualize data to highlight significant findings and trends.

Provide actionable insights to stakeholders and policymakers.​

Data Source
The dataset originates from the City of Toronto's Deaths of Shelter Residents reports. These reports compile data on individuals who passed away while residing in city-administered shelters. For privacy reasons, the data is aggregated and does not include personal identifiers.​

Methodology
Data Cleaning & Preparation
Handled missing values and standardized date formats.

Created derived variables to facilitate analysis.

Aggregated data across gender categories: Male, Female, and Transgender/Non-binary/Two-Spirit.​

Analysis & Visualization
Performed descriptive statistical analyses to explore relationships between variables.

Utilized Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual representations of the data.

Examined correlations between age, gender, and shelter conditions.​

Key Findings
A total of 825 shelter resident deaths were reported between 2007 and 2024, averaging 46 deaths per year.

In 2024, there were 59 reported deaths, a 35% decrease from 2023.

Males accounted for 76% of deaths from 2020 to 2024, despite representing 60% of the shelter population.

The average age at death across all genders was 54 years.

Opioid overdose remains a significant suspected cause of death, though more than half of deaths could not be attributed a cause by shelter staff.​
